F-16 High Fidelity Flight Dynamics and Tech/Academic Initial Demonstration
Build 11-29-2014-0-k

Update to: SkateZilla Build (version?)
Update to: Cpt.Smileys v.3 Build

Important Notes:
This is a High Fidelity Flight Dynamics and Tech/Academic Initial Demonstration,
and it NOT a Combat Ready or Systems Ready Module.
There Are No Functioning Cockpit Systems.

Do NOT Use the External 3D model or Cockpit Model EDMs outside of this Module.
Anyone Caught Moving the 3D External/Cockpit EDMs to Private/Hacked/Jury Rigged Mods, 
Even for Personal Use will be dealt with harsely as it violates the license Agreements for the 3D Assets.
So Once Again, Do NOT use the 3D Model EDMs with any private Mods.


Changes since SkateZilla build:
- fix memory leak in FM code
- some refactoring of code for easier changes and additions later
- reduced few unnecessary memory allocations and memory copying
- possible bugfix in inertia handling, testing needed


Known Issues:
-Landing Gear Collision is not retractable (disabled intentionally)
-Nose Wheel Steering Animation is Disabled (disabled intentionally)
-Landing Gear Strut and Piston Data Needs to be re-done (uses template settings)
 (causes Aircraft Ground handling problems and tipping.)
-Landing Gear Suspension values Need to be tuned
 (Landing still feels a bit off, but is no longer a 100% chance of damaged gear)
-Some Control Surface/Pylon Clipping issues.
-No Speed Brake Systems.
